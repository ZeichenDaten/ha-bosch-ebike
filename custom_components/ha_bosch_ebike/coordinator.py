        all that round) with the last known-good value instead of a

        configured (issue #60 follow-up), its current state is folded into
        the same max() so the display jumps to the live value the moment
        the bike reconnects at home, instead of waiting for the next Bosch
        cloud sync (which can take hours) - the live entity already
        publishes in km, same unit as the cloud value. Only accepted when
        BOTH fresh (changed within LIVE_ODOMETER_BOOST_TOLERANCE - a bridge
        that hasn't seen the bike in a long time keeps reporting its last
        real state as "available" indefinitely, see issues #31/#54 for why
        that distinction matters for this exact class of entity) AND
        plausible (no more than LIVE_ODOMETER_BOOST_MAX_EXCESS_KM above the
        current cloud/floor value - guards against a unit mixup, e.g. a
        misconfigured entity exposing raw metres instead of km, or a
        decode glitch, either of which would otherwise poison this floor
        permanently, unlike the bounded, per-activity use of the same
        entity elsewhere in this file).

        Freshness is checked against last_changed, not last_updated: HA
        bumps last_updated on every write, including a reconnect (HA
        restart, ESPHome reboot, WiFi blip) that merely re-reports the
        SAME cached value, which would otherwise look deceptively "fresh".
        last_changed only moves when the reported VALUE itself actually
        changes, so a stale value replayed unchanged across a reconnect
        keeps its true (old) last_changed. This does not cover the case
        where Home Assistant's own in-memory state is wiped by a full HA
        restart (last_changed also resets then, since there is nothing
        to compare against) - the plausibility bound is the remaining
        safety net for that narrower case.

        Known, accepted limitation: a genuine hardware replacement (new
        drive unit with a lower true odometer) would also stay clamped to
        the old bike's mileage until a new value grows past it again -
        rare enough not to warrant reset-detection logic.

        Floor increases are persisted to disk in a debounced way (see
        _schedule_odometer_floor_save()): this method itself only runs when
        an entity is actually read/written, which is NOT the same as the
        coordinator's own state_changed-gated save. Without this, a floor
        raised purely by the live-entity boost (no new activity, no
        consumption change - nothing that flips state_changed) stayed
        correct in memory for as long as the process kept running, but
        reverted to whatever was last saved on any later HA/integration
        restart, since nothing had ever written the higher value to disk in
        between (issue #60 - reported as a "sawtooth" by crazy-joe28: the
        live-boosted value held fine poll after poll within one running
        session, but a restart in between silently dropped it back to the
        stale, disk-persisted floor).
