# Diagnosis Field Data API (dealer Bosch DiagnosticTool 3 / Capacity Tester

#
# UNLIKE every endpoint above, the Data Act appendix PDF documents these only
# by their relative name ("/batteries", "/drive-units", "/capacity-testers"),
# never the full REST path. Compare: the PDF also calls the Digital Service
# Book endpoint just "/service-records", but the real, confirmed-working path
# is "/service-book/smart-system/v1/service-records" — a prefix segment the
# PDF never spells out anywhere. The true prefix for this family is therefore
# unconfirmed. api.py tries each candidate below once per api-client lifetime
# and caches whichever one responds successfully (see
# BoschEBikeAPI._get_with_path_discovery); if none of them work the affected
# sensors simply stay unavailable, same as the existing "dealer never
# connected a diagnostic tool" case.
